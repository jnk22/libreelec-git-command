# LibreELEC Git Command

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/jnk22/libreelec-git-command/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/jnk22/libreelec-git-command/main)

This script makes it possible to use the command `git` on LibreELEC Kodi
installations, where this is usually not possible.

This solution is based on a forum post in the thread
[Installation of git on Libreelec@LibreELEC Forum](https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread/13874-installation-of-git-on-libreelec/?postID=105152#post105152).

## Installation

The installation script requires the Kodi service addon **Docker** from
_Team LibreELEC_ to be installed on your Kodi system.
If not installed, this script automatically tries to install the addon.

Run

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnk22/libreelec-git-command/main/install-git.sh | bash
```

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnk22/libreelec-git-command/main/install-git.sh>

You can now use the command `git` in your terminal!

_This has been tested with **LibreELEC 10.0.2** (Kodi 19.4) on a Raspberry Pi 3
and Intel NUC7JYB._
